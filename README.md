# ESP32_BLE_Door_Sensor
The sensor detects and sends a signal to the mobile phone via BLE connectivity. It has the functions of a smart magnetic sensor, and an integrated light sensor in order to know the day and night. ESP32 Wi-Fi module is used in this case due to its feasibility of Wi-Fi connection, BLE connection, and classic Bluetooth connection.
Component list:ESP32 module, Reed Switch, LDR Sensor, and Li-Po Battery.
Feature: BLE Door Sensor using ESP32  double-layer PCB  sensing door/window status of open/close and send payload to mobile phone.  sensing light index  Li-Po Battery powering  Can deploy or interconnect with BLE/WiFi/Bluetooth.  Battery status detection  Micro-B USB charging and have circuit protection diode.
